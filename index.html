      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>In 2017 came a seven year long effort to completion. From pitched ideas, prototyped gameplays, alternative storylines and focus testing to an action packed Playstation game - Horizon is a tale of how Guerrila Games <span class="emphasize">dared to take a risk</span> and succeded through collaborative effort.</p>
      <p>Guerilla Games has a history of making Playstation exclusives. They have, as a Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe subsidiary, produced games in the Killzone-series for PS2, PS3 and PS4. After the release of Killzone 3 in 2011 began Guerilla Games an internal competition to find ideas for a new game, separate from the Killzone universe. Forty ideas were pitched. One of these were Horizon.</p>
      <p>The leap from Killzone to Horizon would be a giant undertaking for the game studio. Previous games focused on gritty first person gun action in a dystopic world. The world was gray and blue-tinted. The colour palette was as limited as the player was.</p>
      <p>Horizon is on the other side of the spectrum. Vibrant colours in a world free for the player to explore. A third person action game, Horizon is a world apart from its predecessor. To manage the transition from a focused shooter to an open world gameplay took guts, toil and teamwork.</p>

      <h2>The Plot</h2>
      <p>The year is... <i>unknown</i>. Humankind is no longer what it once was. It's apparent even to the nomads of the world who gazes upon the ruins with disgust. Those places are forbidden. Countless years have destroyed cultures and technological advancements, but the ancients brought destruction upon themselves. They left vicious robots in their wake, but they wouldn't know what it would take to protect and feed a tribe. The tribe is the lifeline, and you do what you can for your tribe.</p>
      <p>Aloy was born an outcast. Without a tribe, but not without a will to survive. Not bound by same traditions tying her down and with another outcast to mentor her, she grows up to become a capable hunter-gatherer. Able to take down robot beasts with arrows she crafted from twigs and scraps. But she's yet to know her mother. And for that she needs to find a way to become a part of the tribe.</p>
